/** @page chapter2 C2: %Executor

After you create a task dependency graph, you need to submit it to threads for execution.
In this chapter, we will show you how to execute a task dependency graph.

@section C2_CreateAnExecutor Create an Executor

To execute a taskflow, you need to create an @em executor of type tf::Executor.
An executor is a @em thread-safe object that 
manages a set of worker threads and executes tasks
through an efficient @em work-stealing algorithm.
Issuing a call to run a taskflow creates a @em topology,
a data structure to keep track of the execution status of a running graph.
tf::Executor takes an unsigned integer to construct with @c N worker threads.
The default value is std::thread::hardware_concurrency.

@code{.cpp}
tf::Executor executor1;     // create an executor of std::thread::hardware_concurrency worker threads
tf::Executor executor2(4);  // create an executor of 4 worker threads
@endcode

An executor can be reused to execute multiple taskflows.
In most workloads, you may need only one executor to run multiple taskflows
where each taskflow represents a part of a parallel decomposition.

@section C2_ExecuteATaskflow Execute a Taskflow

tf::Executor provides a set of @c run\_* methods,
tf::Executor::run, 
tf::Executor::run_n, and tf::Executor::run_until to run a taskflow
for one time, multiple times, or until a given predicate evaluates to true.
All methods accept an optional callback to invoke after the execution completes,
and return a std::future for users to access the execution status.
The code below shows several ways to run a taskflow.

@code{.cpp}
 1: // Declare an executor and a taskflow
 2: tf::Executor executor;
 3: tf::Taskflow taskflow;
 4:
 5: // Add three tasks into the taskflow
 6: tf::Task A = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "This is TaskA\n"; });
 7: tf::Task B = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "This is TaskB\n"; });
 8: tf::Task C = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "This is TaskC\n"; });
 9: 
10: // Build precedence between tasks
11: A.precede(B, C); 
12: 
13: std::future<void> fu = executor.run(taskflow);
14: fu.wait();                // block until the execution completes
15:
16: executor.run(taskflow, [](){ std::cout << "end of one execution\n"; }).wait();
17: executor.run_n(taskflow, 4);
18: executor.wait_for_all();  // block until all associated executions finish
19: executor.run_n(taskflow, 4, [](){ std::cout << "end of four executions\n"; }).wait();
20: executor.run_until(taskflow, [int cnt=0] () mutable { return (++cnt == 10); });
@endcode


Debrief:

@li Line 6-8   creates a taskflow of three tasks A, B, and C
@li Line 13-14 runs the taskflow once and use std::future::wait to wait for completion 
@li Line 16    runs the taskflow once with a callback to invoke when the execution finishes
@li Line 17-18 runs the taskflow four times and use tf::Executor::wait_for_all to wait for completion 
@li Line 19    runs the taskflow four times and invokes a callback at the end of the forth execution
@li Line 20    keeps running the taskflow until the predicate returns true

Issuing multiple runs on the same taskflow will automatically @em synchronize
to a sequential chain of executions in the order of run calls.

@code{.cpp}
executor.run(taskflow);         // execution 1
executor.run_n(taskflow, 10);   // execution 2
executor.run(taskflow);         // execution 3
executor.wait_for_all();        // execution 1 -> execution 2 -> execution 3
@endcode

A key point to notice is a running taskflow must remain alive during its execution.
It is your responsibility to ensure a taskflow not being destructed
when it is running.
For example, the code below can result undefined behavior.

@code{.cpp}
tf::Executor executor;  // create an executor

// create a taskflow whose lifetime is restricted by the scope
{
  tf::Taskflow taskflow;
  
  // add tasks to the taskflow
  // ... 

  // run the taskflow
  executor.run(f);

} // at this point, taskflow might get destructed while it is running, resulting in defined behavior
@endcode

Similarly, you should avoid touching a taskflow while it is running.

@code{.cpp}
tf::Taskflow taskflow;

// Add tasks into the taskflow
// ...

// Declare an executor
tf::Executor executor;

std::future<void> future = taskflow.run(f);  // non-blocking return

// alter the taskflow while running leads to undefined behavior 
f.emplace([](){ std::cout << "Add a new task\n"; });
@endcode

A rule of thumb is to always keep a taskflow alive in your function scope 
while it is participating in an execution.


@section C2_ThreadSafety Thread Safety

All @c run\_* methods are @em thread-safe.
You can have multiple threads call these methods from an executor to run different taskflows.
However, the order which taskflow runs first is non-deterministics and is up to the 
runtime.

@code{.cpp}
 1: tf::Executor executor;
 2:
 3: for(int i=0; i<10; ++i) {
 4:   std::thread([i, &](){
 5:     // ... modify my taskflow
 6:     executor.run(taskflows[i]);  // run my taskflow
 7:   }).detach();
 8: }
@endcode

It is your responsibility to ensure all taskflows from different threads 
remain alive during their executions; or it can result unexpected behavior or program crash.

@section C2_Observer Observe Thread Activities

You can observe thread activities in an executor when a worker thread particiates in executing
a task and leaves the execution using tf::ObserverInterface.
tf::ObserverInterface is an @em interface class that provides a set of methods for you to define
what to do when a thread enters and leaves the execution context of a task.

@code{.cpp}
class ObserverInterface {

  virtual ~ObserverInterface() = default;
  
  virtual void set_up(size_t num_workers) = 0;
  
  virtual void on_entry(size_t worker_id, tf::TaskView task_view) = 0;
  
  virtual void on_exit(size_t worker_id, tf::TaskView task_view) = 0;
};
@endcode

There are three methods you must define in your derived class, 
tf::ObserverInterface::set_up, tf::ObserverInterface::on_entry, and 
tf::ObserverInterface::on_exit.
The method, tf::ObserverInterface::set_up, is a constructor-like method that 
will be called by the executor when the observer is constructed.
It passes an argument of the number of workers to observer in the executor.
You may use it to preallocate or initialize data storage, e.g., an independent vector for each worker.
The methods, tf::ObserverInterface::on_entry and
tf::ObserverInterface::on_exit,
are called by a worker thread before and after the execution context of a task,
respectively.
You may use them to record timepoints and calculate the elapsed time of a task.

You can associate an executor with one or multiple observers (though one is common)
using tf::Executor::make_observer.
We use std::shared_ptr to manage the ownership of an observer.
The executor loops through each observer and invoke the corresponding methods accordingly.

@code{.cpp}
 1 #include <taskflow/taskflow.hpp>
 2
 3 struct MyObserver : public tf::ObserverInterface {
 4
 5   MyObserver(const std::string& name) {
 6     std::cout << "constructing observer " << name << '\n';
 7   }
 8
 9   void set_up(size_t num_workers) override final {
10     std::cout << "settting up observer with " << num_workers << " workers\n";
11   }
12
13   void on_entry(size_t w, tf::TaskView tv) override final {
14     std::ostringstream oss;
15     oss << "worker " << w << " ready to run " << tv.name() << '\n';
16     std::cout << oss.str();
17   }
18
19   void on_exit(size_t w, tf::TaskView tv) override final {
20     std::ostringstream oss;
21     oss << "worker " << w << " finished running " << tv.name() << '\n';
22     std::cout << oss.str();
23   }
24
25 };
26
27 int main(){
28
29   tf::Executor executor(4);
30
31   // Create a taskflow of eight tasks
32   tf::Taskflow taskflow;
33
34   auto A = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "1\n"; }).name("A");
35   auto B = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "2\n"; }).name("B");
36   auto C = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "3\n"; }).name("C");
37   auto D = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "4\n"; }).name("D");
38   auto E = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "5\n"; }).name("E");
39   auto F = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "6\n"; }).name("F");
40   auto G = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "7\n"; }).name("G");
41   auto H = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "8\n"; }).name("H");
42 
43   // create an observer
44   std::shared_ptr<MyObserver> observer = executor.make_observer<MyObserver>("MyObserver");
45 
46   // run the taskflow
47   executor.run(taskflow).get();
48 
49   // remove the observer (optional)
50   executor.remove_observer(std::move(observer));
51 
52   return 0;
53 }
@endcode

The above code produces the following output:

@code{.bash}
constructing observer MyObserver
settting up observer with 4 workers
worker 2 ready to run A
1
worker 2 finished running A
worker 2 ready to run B
2
worker 1 ready to run C
worker 2 finished running B
3
worker 2 ready to run D
worker 3 ready to run E
worker 1 finished running C
4
5
worker 1 ready to run F
worker 2 finished running D
worker 3 finished running E
6
worker 2 ready to run G
worker 3 ready to run H
worker 1 finished running F
7
8
worker 2 finished running G
worker 3 finished running H
@endcode

It is expected each line of std::cout interleaves with each other 
as there are four workers participating in task scheduling.
However, the @em ready message always appears before the corresponding task message 
(e.g., numbers)
and then the  @em finished message.
